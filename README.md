# Concrete factory technique

Repository with examples of the Concrete Factory technique used in the classes about design principles and patterns taugh by Rodrigo Martins Pagliares at UNIFAL-MG (Computer Science Undergraduate course).

## Dependencies

The examples use two simple jar files representing external systems (one inventory and one accounting system) from different brands (IBM, ITAUTEC, SAP). They are included in the lib folder of the Maven Project presented in this repository.

Note: If you are getting the error message "Cannot resolve Symbol AccountingSystem", "Cannot resolve Symbol InventorySystem", try to include both jar files in the build path of the IDE you are using. In IntelliJ, for example, just right click the jar file and select "Adds as library" -> Project Library Level.
